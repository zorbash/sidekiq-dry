## Unreleased

## [1.1.3] - 2022-05-15

### Changed

* Bumped sidekiq to 6.4.2
* Stringified args to ensure JSON-compatiblity to fix - Job arguments
do not serialize to JSON safely. This would have raised an error in
Sidekiq 7.0.

## [1.1.2] - 2021-12-11

### Changed

* Bumped sidekiq dependency for CVE-2021-30151

## [1.1.1] - 2021-02-24

### Changed

* When an exception is raised, the original (before Dry::Struct deserialization) arguments
  are reset so that other middlewares (think exception reporting) don't have to deal with
  Dry::Struct.
